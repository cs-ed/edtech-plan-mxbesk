# Educational Technology Plan

This educational technology plan provides an overview of the software, hardware, and resources needed to implement Integrated Math 1 with Computing & Robotics in the 2022-2023 academic year. This plan also describes the context in which this course will be offered, the cost of implementation, instructional approach and strategies, as well as the resiliency plan in place should the school site need to shift between in-person, virtual, and hybrid learning.

## Context

### Course

Integrated Math 1 with Computing & Robotics was developed in collaboration among teachers and the UC Davis C-STEM Center. The course has already been A-G approved.

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
